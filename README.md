`genability-java` is a Java client library for the [Genability APIs](http://genability.com).

# How to get going:

1. Get an appId at https://apps.genability.com/profile/organizations/current or [sign up](https://apps.genability.com/explorer/signup) if you are new to Genability.
2. Put the appId and appKey in the `src/main/resources/genability.properties` file.
3. Compile the library and run JUnit tests with `mvn test`.
4. Develop your own app. Read the API documentation at http://developer.genability.com.

You can see the Javadocs [here](http://genability.github.io/genability-java/javadoc/). There's also a quick tutorial on using this library [here](http://genability.github.io/genability-java/tutorial.html).
