Welcome to the home page for the Java client library for Genability's API. We're just getting started but, in the future, this is where we'll put everything having to do with our client libraries and APIs, including:

* Sample code
* Javadocs / PyDocs / RubyDocs / *Docs
* Tutorials and How-Tos
* API specifications

For now, just enjoy the scenery. You can still see our current documentation page [here](http://developer.genability.com/documentation/). Links to existing libraries are located [here](libraries.html).
